  <title>edge 17 pause() bug</title>
</head>
<body>
  <p>
    Playback should be paused. In edge 16 this is the case. In edge 17 it is not. It seems that the <code>play()</code> call
    gets buffered until after the `load()` call, and no other `pause()` calls cancel it.
  </p>
  
  <audio controls crossorigin="anonymous" src="./test.mp3" id="audio"></audio>
  
  <script type="text/javascript">
    var audio = document.getElementById('audio');


    // this play() looks like it is getting applied after the load() call
    audio.play().then(function() {
      console.log('success');

      //the pause below does apply
      //audio.pause();

    }, function(e) { console.log('error', e); });


    // this should reject the play() call above
    // but it doesn't
    audio.pause();

    audio.load();

    // We now start playing even though pause() was called
    // above


    // uncommenting any of following doesn't make a difference
    // audio.pause();

    //window.setTimeout(function() {
    //  console.log('calling pause()');
    //  audio.pause();
    //}, 0);

  </script>
